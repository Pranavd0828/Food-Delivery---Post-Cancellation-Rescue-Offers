# Product Strategy: Rescue Radar

## What
Rescue Radar is a realtime marketplace for last-minute food cancellations. It connects hungry users with nearby restaurants that have unclaimed orders.

### Pricing & Economics
The discount strategy is not random. It is calculated based on **Sunk Cost Recovery**.
1. **The Cost of Zero**: To a restaurant, a cancelled order is worth $0. It is a total loss.
2. **Recovery Minimum**: Selling at 30 percent covers the raw ingredient cost.
3. **The "Rescue" Sweet Spot**: We target **50 percent to 70 percent off** to maximize impulse velocity. At 50 percent off, the restaurant recovers costs plus a small margin. At 70 percent off (for older items), the goal is purely waste reduction and brand exposure.

We use **Dynamic Decay** for pricing. An item might start at 50 percent off. If it is not claimed within 15 minutes, it drops to 60 percent off. This rewards users who act fast and ensures inventory is cleared before closing.

## Why
Food waste is a massive problem for restaurants and the environment. When an order is cancelled or not picked up, the food is often thrown away. This results in lost revenue for the restaurant and unnecessary carbon emissions. Rescue Radar turns this loss into a win for everyone. Restaurants recover costs. Users get premium food for cheap. The environment suffers less waste.

## Why Now
Three factors make this the perfect time for Rescue Radar.
1. **Economic Pressure**: Inflation has made food delivery expensive. Consumers are actively seeking deals and lower prices.
2. **Gig Economy Density**: In dense cities, there are enough users and restaurants to make a 15-minute pickup window viable.
3. **Sustainability Awareness**: Modern consumers prefer brands that align with their eco-friendly values. Eating "rescued" food feels good ethically and financially.

## How
We execute this through a hyper-local, gamified interface.
1. **Realtime Urgency**: Offers are only live for a short window (for example, 30 minutes). This drives immediate action.
2. **The Hold Mechanism**: Users must "hold" an order for 90 seconds to secure it. This prevents double-booking while adding excitement.
3. **Map-First Discovery**: Users see deals physically near them. This encourages walking or short drives, which is faster than waiting for a new delivery driver.
4. **Social Proof**: A live ticker shows what others are rescuing. This builds trust and the feeling of a bustling marketplace.
